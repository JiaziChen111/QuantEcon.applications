Solves the price function for the Lucas tree in a continuous state
setting, using piecewise linear approximation for the sequence of
candidate price functions.  The consumption endownment follows the log
linear AR(1) process

.. math::

    log y' = \alpha log y + \sigma \epsilon

where y' is a next period y and epsilon is an iid standard normal shock.
Hence

.. math::

    y' = y^{\alpha} * \xi,

where

.. math::

    \xi = e^(\sigma * \epsilon)

The distribution phi of xi is

.. math::

    \phi = LN(0, \sigma^2),

where LN means lognormal.

    The approximate Lucas operator, which computes and returns the

    ----------
    f : array_like(float)
        A candidate function on R_+ represented as points on a grid

    Notes

    The argument `Tf` is optional, but recommended. If it is passed
    into this function, then we do not have to allocate any memory
    for the array here. As this function is often called many times
    in an iterative algorithm, this can save significant computation
    time.
